# jachero55.restaurant.github.io
This website is about restaurant. I have implemented cart functionality, responsive design and many more
# Then I have used npm install sass --save-dev. The --save-dav adds it to the json
# Then created src  folder to hold the file structure
# We are installing bundler using npm install parcel-bundler --save-dev and save it as dev

# Run this command to watch sass: sass --watch src/scss/main.scss:src/css/main.css
